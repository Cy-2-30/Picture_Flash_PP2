# Welcome to Memory Game 


The project is an interactive Memory Game, created around the "Back to School" theme. The aim of the project is to showcase the knowledge and ability gained on **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**. 



## How the game works?


The game flashes cards for few seconds on the start and the player has limited moves to finish the game. The player has 3 hints to help throughout all the level (**Caution: to be used sparingly**) and if the player finishes the game, any remaining moves will be carried over to the next level. Any matched pairs will be counted as points and to win the player must match all the cards, otherwise it will result in a loss.

## Technical Design


### Wireframe


The game application uses the bottom-up approach in the styling design. The application is designed for: -
* Any device with 480px and below viewport,
* Any device between 481px to 780px viewport,
* Any device between 781px and 1024px viewport,
* And any device above 1021px viewport.

The pages content will be the same across all the viewports and the difference is in the structure layout depending on the size. The style and design will be the same across all different device’s viewports. 


<details><summary>Click to view the game initial design.</summary>


* __Home__ - It is the landing page and is consistent across all viewports
