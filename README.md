## Introduction
### **WITCH** - _Women's Information Technology Careers Hub_
Our team wanted to create an application that empowers women who might be thinking of starting in tech but come up against some of the common stigmas associated with the industry. Tech is all too often seen as a male domain and this can cause hesitancy and imposter syndrome to set in. Not anymore! **WITCH** helps those seeking a start in tech to find a career path that suits them, as well as helpful resources to get them on their way. Those working in tech can use the site to help others by sharing their stories from the inside!
